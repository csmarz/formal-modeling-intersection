# formal-modeling-intersection
This repository contains NuSMV file used for the formal modeling of traffic lights controller for intersection with contraflow lanes (the file NuSMV-4armedjunction.smv).

In addition, we also put an animation video which illustrates the operation (i.e., lights transition) of our proposed traffic lights controller for the intersection with contraflow lanes (the file 4armed-junction-contraflow.mkv)

The contraflow lanes are designed based on the proposed designated contraflow lanes for TransJakarta, a bus rapid transit system in Jakarta, Indonesia.
