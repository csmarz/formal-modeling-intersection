# formal-modeling-intersection
This repository contains NuSMV file used for the formal modeling of traffic lights controller for intersection with contraflow lanes.
In addition, we also put an animation video which illustrates the operation (i.e., lights transition) of our proposed traffic lights controller for the intersection with contraflow lanes.
The contraflow lanes are designed based on the proposed designated contraflow lanes for TransJakarta, a bus rapid transit system in Jakarta, Indonesia.
